## **My Workflow Supercharged:** How Gemini CLI Revolutionized My Vibe Coding
<sub>November 11, 2025</sub>
<br></br>

I don't consider myself a traditional coder who builds or knows everything to build from scratch. I like to be the orchestrator, the one who has the vision and directs the tools to bring it to life. For a while, my process for building this website was anything but grave. It was a slow, boring, and manual grind.

It started with an idea and a conversation with the Gemini web chat. I'd get a block of code, copy it into VS Code, make some minor changes, and then manually upload the files to my server. Every single change, no matter how small, required the same tedious process. It was a workflow that killed momentum and pushed creative ideas to "tomorrow."

Then, everything changed. I stumbled upon a Network Chuck video about running Gemini directly in the terminal. This wasn't just a small improvement; it was a paradigm shift.

This is what I call "supercharged vibe coding."

My new workflow is built on a simple philosophy: **the best way to learn quickly is to fail fast.** The Gemini CLI, combined with Git, has become the engine for this philosophy. Now, I can have an idea, conceptualize it, prototype it, deploy it, test it, find the issues, and repair them at a speed I never thought possible. The frustration is gone, replaced by a dopamine rush that has me coding at 1 AM, excited to build out my homelab and website through the night.

My process is a continuous loop:

1.  **Local Changes:** I make changes to the site on my local machine.
2.  **Local Preview:** I run a local Jekyll server to see how it looks and feels.
3.  **Push to Git:** Once I like what I see, I ask my Gemini agent to commit and push the code to GitHub.
4.  **Automated Checks & Deployment:** A GitHub Actions workflow automatically tests the build. If everything is working as it should, it deploys the site directly to my hosting server.

Of course, sometimes things don't go as planned. A build fails, and an error pops up. But that's no longer a roadblock. I copied the error log, pasted it into my Gemini-CLI, and asked, "What's happening here?" Most of the time, it's something silly that gets solved right there and then.

It hasn't all been smooth sailing. I hit a major wall when I tried to implement a web-based Content Management System (CMS) so I could write posts from a web interface. I spent a lot of time with my agent trying to figure out why it wouldn't work. I still suspect it has to do with the limitations of my basic hosting plan, but it was a valuable lesson in understanding the boundaries of my environment. We also wrestled with a search bar that initially appeared on every page before we managed to isolate it to just the projects page.

Each challenge, however, is just another lap in this rapid-fire learning cycle. With an AI system that can keep up with my ideas, I'm no longer just a user—I'm an orchestrator, turning concepts into reality at the speed of thought.

Alright, the dopamine is wearing off, and my bed is calling. It's time to sign off.
