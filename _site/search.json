      "date": "November 09, 2025",
      "body": "This is a short introduction to the project. We will be building a home lab from scratch using Proxmox for virtualization, pfSense for routing and firewall, and several virtual machines to host various services. The goal is to create a stable, secure, and well-documented environment for testing and learning.Below is the index of this report. You can click on any item to jump directly to that section.  Section 1: Hardware Selection          1.1 CPU and Motherboard      1.2 RAM and Storage        Section 2: Proxmox Installation and Configuration          2.1 Initial Installation      2.2 Network Configuration        Section 3: ConclusionSection 1: Hardware SelectionIn this section, we discuss the hardware chosen for the project. We’ll cover the CPU, RAM, storage, and networking components. The focus is on balancing performance, power consumption, and cost.1.1 CPU and MotherboardDetails about the processor and motherboard choice. We’ll look at core count, clock speed, and power efficiency.1.2 RAM and StorageDetails about the memory and storage configuration. We’ll discuss the benefits of ECC RAM and the different storage tiers (NVMe, SSD, HDD).Section 2: Proxmox Installation and ConfigurationThis section walks through the installation of Proxmox VE. We will cover the initial setup, network configuration, and storage setup.2.1 Initial InstallationStep-by-step guide to installing Proxmox from a USB drive.2.2 Network ConfigurationConfiguring the Linux bridges and bonds for management and VM traffic.Section 3: ConclusionA summary of the project so far and a look at the next steps. We will discuss the challenges faced and the lessons learned."

      "title": "My Workflow Supercharged: How the Gemini CLI Revolutionized My Vibe Coding",
      "url": "/projects/2025-11-11-my-workflow-supercharged/",
      "date": "November 11, 2025",
      "body": "I don’t consider myself a traditional coder who builds everything from scratch. I like to be the orchestrator, the one who has the vision and directs the tools to bring it to life. For a while, my process for building this website was anything but orchestral. It was a slow, boring, and manual grind.It started with an idea and a conversation with the Gemini web chat. I’d get a block of code, copy it into VSCode, make some tiny changes, and then manually upload the files to my server. Every single change, no matter how small, required the same tedious process. It was a workflow that killed momentum and pushed creative ideas to “tomorrow.”Then, everything changed. I stumbled upon a Network Chuck video about running Gemini directly in the terminal. This wasn’t just a small improvement; it was a paradigm shift.This is what I call “supercharged vibe coding.”My new workflow is built on a simple philosophy: the best way to learn fast is to fail fast. The Gemini CLI, combined with Git, has become the engine for this philosophy. Now, I can have an idea, conceptualize it, prototype it, deploy it, test it, find the issues, and repair them at a speed I never thought possible. The frustration is gone, replaced by a dopamine rush that has me coding at 1 AM, excited to build out my homelab and website through the night.My process is a continuous loop:  Local Changes: I make changes to the site on my local machine.  Local Preview: I run a local Jekyll server to see how it looks and feels.  Push to Git: Once I like what I see, I ask my Gemini agent to commit and push the code to GitHub.  Automated Checks &amp;amp; Deployment: A GitHub Actions workflow automatically tests the build. If everything is working as it should, it deploys the site directly to my hosting server.Of course, sometimes things don’t go according to plan. A build fails, an error pops up. But that’s no longer a roadblock. I copy the error log, paste it to my Gemini agent, and ask, “What’s happening here?” Most of the time, it’s something silly that gets solved right there and then.It hasn’t all been smooth sailing. I hit a major wall when I tried to implement a web-based Content Management System (CMS) so I could write posts from a web interface. I spent a lot of time with my agent trying to figure out why it wouldn’t work. I still suspect it has to do with the limitations of my basic hosting plan, but it was a valuable lesson in understanding the boundaries of my environment. We also wrestled with a search bar that initially appeared on every page before we managed to isolate it to just the projects page.Each challenge, however, is just another lap in this rapid-fire learning cycle. With an AI system that can keep up with my ideas, I’m no longer just a user—I’m an orchestrator, turning concepts into reality at the speed of thought.Alright, the dopamine is wearing off, and my bed is calling. It’s time to sign off."
